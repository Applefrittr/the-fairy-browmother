  "text": "I'm Sam, your fairy Browmother — a mother of three, an artist, an animal lover, and an all-things-spooky enthusiast. My love for makeup started as a young kid digging into my mother's makeup bag. Aside from lashes, doing my eyebrows was my favorite part of my makeup routine growing up. I spent many years perfecting my brow routine, but it was quite time-consuming.  Once I stumbled upon ombré powder brows, I knew I needed to have them done, but little did I know I'd be able to make a career out of it. With my love for makeup and tattooing, I now have the power to help others love and enjoy their brows as much as I do mine without the hassle of applying makeup daily."
