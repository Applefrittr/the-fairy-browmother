    "question": "What are ombré powder brows?",
    "answer": "Ombré powder brows are a semi permanent tattoo to create the perfect brow."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it the same as micro blading?",
    "answer": "No. Microblading uses a single blade to create individual hair strokes. Ombré powder brows are done with a tattoo pen and a fine needle using a shading technique to create a soft and powdery makeup look. A benefit of this is that ombré powder brows are not as harsh or invasive on the skin."

    "question": "How often is a touch up needed?",
    "answer": "A touch-up is needed 12 weeks after the initial appointment. Generally after that, a touch-up is only needed every 1–3 years. Various factors can contribute to how often a touch-up is needed, including skin type, aftercare, skincare routine, and sun exposure."

  {
    "question": "How long is the appointment?",
    "answer": "Generally, the appointment takes about 4 hours, but it's important to keep your schedule clear afterward, as this time can fluctuate. We want to proceed in a leisurely fashion to ensure you leave loving your new brows."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the process?",
    "answer": "A large portion of the appointment will consist of mapping out your brows. The key to a perfect brow is a perfect map. After confirming you're happy with the shape, we'll tattoo the outline and the first pass. 2–3 passes will be done depending on your preference for how dark you'd like them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I expect after the appointment?",
    "answer": "Swelling, soreness, and redness are normal on the first day. Advil or Tylenol can be taken after the procedure to help with any discomfort. From days 1 to 5, the brows will appear extremely dark and thick. They will start to get dry and itchy. DO NOT scratch or pick at them. From days 6 to 14, the brows will start to crack, and scabs will begin to fall off. It's important to let the scabs fall off naturally. Pulling them off can cause many issues. From days 15 to 30, the brows will appear very light, and the pigment will slowly start to resurface during the natural regeneration cycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does after care consist of?",
    "answer": "After washing your hands, wet a cotton pad with purified water and dab the brows lightly. Do this both morning and night until the scabs have completely fallen off. Avoid getting the brows wet as much as possible, including in the shower or through sweating. DO NOT apply anything to the brows until fully healed, including makeup and skincare products. Let the scabs dry out completely and fall off on their own. Keep the brows out of direct sunlight. DO NOT wax or thread the brows until healed."
