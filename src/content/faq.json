    "question": "What can I expect after the appointment?",
    "answer": "Swelling, soreness, and redness are normal on the first day.  Advil or Tylenol can be taken after the procedure to help with any discomfort.  Days 1 to 5, brows will appear extremely dark and thick.  They will start to get dry and itchy.  DO NOT itch them.  Days 6 to 14, brows will start to crack and scabs will start to fall off.  It's important to let the scabs fall off naturally.  Pulling scabs off can cause many issues.  Days 15 to 30, brows will appear very light.  Pigment will slowly start to resurface during the natural regeneration cycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does after care consist of?",
    "answer": "After washing hands, wet a cotton pad with purified water and dab brows lightly.  Do both morning and night until scabs have completely fallen off.  Avoid getting brows wet as much as possible.  This includes avoiding getting them wet in the shower or by sweating.  DO NOT appy anything to brows until healing including make up and skin care products.  Let scabs dry out completely and fall off on their own.  Keep brows out of direct sunlight.  DO NOT wax or thread brows until healed."
